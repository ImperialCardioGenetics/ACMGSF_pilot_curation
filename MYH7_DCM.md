**ClinGen Haploinsufficiency phenotype comments:**

To date only articles discussing missense mutations in the MYH7 gene
have been described in the literature as being associated with Familial
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, **dilated cardiomyopathy**, Laing Distal
Myopathy (LDM), Myosin Storage Myopathy (PMID:23346452, 12788380,
12707239, 21846512, 25576864,24664454 ). PMID: 12788380 does however
describe a three base pair deletion leading to an amnio acid loss
glutamic acid in position 927. There was no disruption of the reading
frame downstream of the deletion.

**Literature review:**

**From our in-house Atlas of DCM:**

All Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic variants are missense

One nonsense variant is a 'hot' VUS

Good evidence MYH7 missense variants account for 5-6% of DCM

No evidence that truncating variants are pathogenic.
