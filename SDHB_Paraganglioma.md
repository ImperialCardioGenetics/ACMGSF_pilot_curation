In addition to the Iberian founder mutation, a Dutch founder deletion has also been described, involving exon 3 (c.201-4429_287-933del) (PMID: 25827221). A deletion of exons 1 and 2 has also been reported in an individual of Japanese descent (PMID:20379037).

Andrews et al (2017) performed a retrospective survey of 1832 individuals with personal or family history of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. **A total of 673 had germline SDHB variants detected, of which 36 had single or multi-exon deletions and duplications. The most common copy number variants were exon 1 deletion (n=18, 49%), exon 3 deletion (n=5, 14%) and whole gene deletion (n=2, 5.6%). No whole gene duplications were identified.**

PMID: 27485256
Hoekstra et al (2016) utilized MLPA analysis and breakpoint mapping of index patients with paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma who had tested negative for SDH gene sequence variants to identify 7 unique intragenic deletions within SDHB in 8 cases (no other genes involved). Two cases with whole gene deletion were also detected (contiguous multi-gene deletion confirmed for one, other unknown). Inheritance was not assessed.

PMID: 19454582
Burnichon et al (2009) tested a cohort of 445 patients with paragangliomas. Germline SHDB variants were identified in 96 patients, of which four unique large deletions, 12 frameshift, 7 splice site, 12 nonsense and 23 missense. Of the large deletions, one was the ~20kb deletion described by Cascon et al.

PMID: 12618761
Benn et al (2003) identified novel SDHB variants in the probands from four families and two apparently sporadic cases (six of seven probands studied), including two missense mutations, a single nonsense and frameshift mutation, as well as two splice site mutations, one of which was shown to have partial penetrance resulting in 'leaky' splicing.

PMID:19351833
A patient with paraganglioma in Neumann et al (2009) showed an exon 3 duplication, but there are no reports of whole gene duplication.

Baysal and Maher (2015) note that for "germline SDHB mutations, the increased use of presymptomatic genetic testing in extended families has resulted in recognition that the penetrance of SDHB mutations is lower than initially thought. Thus initial estimates of the penetrance of germline SDHB mutations were in excess of 70% but have progressively fallen to 25?40% (Benn et al. 2006, Solis et al. 2009, Hes et al. 2010, Ricketts et al. 2010, Schiavi et al. 2010)."

**Literature review:**

SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD are four nuclear genes responsible for hereditary PGL/PCC syndromes. They encode the four subunits of the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH).

SDHA, SDHAF2, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD are tumor suppressor genes. Somatic second-hit variants in tumors include gross chromosomal rearrangements, recombination, single-nucleotide variants, or epigenetic changes that result in allelic inactivation.

**Nonsense, missense, splice site variants, intragenic deletions and insertions, and whole-gene SDHB deletions have been reported in individuals/pedigrees affected with hereditary PGL/PCC syndromes. More than 100 pathogenic sequence variants have been described for SDHB.** A database of normal and pathogenic variants for the SDH subunit genes is maintained by the Leiden University Medical Center (see Table A). SDHB variants are predominantly found in exons 1-7.

**Large SDHB deletions have been reported, most commonly involving SDHB exon 1, but also other multiexon deletions and whole-gene deletions** [Cascón et al 2006, Burnichon et al 2009, Neumann et al 2009, Solis et al 2009, Buffet et al 2012, Rattenberry et al 2013].

Pathogenic variants in SDHB result in reduced or absent succinate dehydrogenase function because of loss or dysfunction of the affected subunit, or failure of the SDH heterotetramer to assemble.

Three hundred and forty-four probands and 436 of their relatives harboured an intragenic mutation in SDHB/SDHC/SDHD
(table 1). Forty-five intragenic mutations in 134 probands were
reported previously.10 The ratio of mutation classes among
probands was similar to that reported previously10 (44%
missense, 15% nonsense, 13% splice-site, 15% frameshift,
0.5% inframe deletions and 12% large CNAs). There were a number of recurrent mutations, for example, SDHB splice-site
c.72+1G>Tand SDHD missense c.242C>T (p.Pro81Leu)
mutations accounted for 20% of probands, and the 10 most
common mutations accounted for 48% (see online supplementary figure 3).

We unequivocally confirmed that SDHD mutation carriers had a
higher overall penetrance for symptomatic tumours and a higher
risk of head and neck paraganglioma (HNPGL) compared with SDHB, whereas SDHB mutation carriers had a higher risk of malignancy and were significantly more likely to develop phaeochromocytoma
and paraganglioma (PPGL).

Male SDHB mutation carriers have a higher age-related penetrance of PPGL/HNPGL (P=0.0034) and PPGL (P=0.0079),
compared with women

A comprehensive database of germline SDHB and SDHD
mutations is maintained at http://chromium.liacs.nl/
LOVD2/SDH/home.php (Bayley et al. 2005). A wide variety
of intragenic mutations have been described and, more
recently, single or multiple exon deletions (and, occasionally, intragenic duplications; McWhinney et al. 2004,
Cascon et al. 2008, Neumann et al. 2009). 

A number of frequent SDHB and SDHD mutations were observed and
these may result from a high mutation rate or to founder
effects. 

Particularly for germline SDHB mutations, the
increased use of presymptomatic genetic testing in
extended families has resulted in recognition that the
penetrance of SDHB mutations is lower than initially
thought. Thus initial estimates of the penetrance of
germline SDHB mutations were in excess of 70% but
have progressively fallen to 25–40% (Benn et al. 2006, Solis
et al. 2009, Hes et al. 2010, Ricketts et al. 2010, Schiavi et al.
2010). The relatively low penetrance of SDHB mutations is
consistent with the observation of a low de novo mutation
rate, frequent founder mutations and the relatively high
number of mutations detected in apparently isolated cases
(Baysal et al. 2002, Neumann et al. 2002, Cascon et al.
2009, Jafri et al. 2013)

**For SDHB mutations, extra-adrenal and non-HNPGL is more often
the presenting feature than HNPGL or pheochromocytoma, and there is a significantly higher risk of malignant
paraganglioma and poor prognosis** (w25% lifetime risk;
Gimenez-Roqueplo et al. 2003, Amar et al. 2007, Ricketts
et al. 2010). 

SDH-mutated PPGLs show robust expression of hypoxia
induced genes, and genomic and histone hypermethylation. These effects occur in part through succinate-mediated inhibition of a-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases.
Mutations in SDH subunits account for most familial and
sporadic HNPGLs and PPGLs, and have also been linked
to other neoplasms including GISTs, renal cancer, and
pituitary adenomas. Abundant evidence suggests that
constitutive hypoxic stimulation plays an important role
in development of SDH-mutated paraganglioma tumors.
However, mechanisms by which SDH regulates oxygen
sensing and signaling are poorly understood.

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

Deletions and loss of function mutations in SDHB are associated with paraganglioms. Pathogenic variants in SDHB result in reduced or absent succinate dehydrogenase function because of loss or dysfunction of the affected subunit or failure of the SDH heterotetramer to assemble. Details of mechanisms by which SDH mutations activate hypoxic pathways and trigger subsequent neoplastic transformation remain poorly understood. Nonsense, missense, and splice site variants, intragenic insertions and deletions, and a whole-gene deletion have been reported in SDHB. 
Large SDHB deletions have been reported, most commonly involving SDHB exon 1, but also other multiexon deletions and whole-gene deletions.For SDHB mutations, extra-adrenal and non-HNPGL is more often the presenting feature than HNPGL or pheochromocytoma, and there is a significantly higher risk of malignant
paraganglioma and poor prognosis (25% lifetime risk).
Initial estimates of the penetrance of
germline SDHB mutations were in excess of 70% but
have progressively fallen to 25–40%.
