**ClinGen Evidence for Haploinsufficiency**

PMID 22241717 - SDHAF2 (also known SDH5) is a tumor suppressor gene which encodes for a protein required for flavination of a succinate dehydrogenase subunit. A novel frameshift mutation was reported by Piccini et al 2012 (PMID: 22241717) in a 44-year-old woman diagnosed with paraganglioma, but with a negative family history. In exon 4, she had c.357-358insT (p.Tyr119LeufsX7) mutation which has not been observed in other patients and there was no indication that other family members were tested.

PMID 26096992 - Zhu et al 2015 (PMID 26096992) assessed the frequency of germline mutations in Chinese patients with head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGL) without family history. They identified one female patient who had early age of onset of HNPGL who had a novel truncation mutation c.130C>T (p.Gln44Ter).

In a Dutch kindred and a Spanish family (proven to be unrelated by high-density SNP array of 610,000 SNPs) with early onset of head and neck paragangliomas (Hao et al (2009), PMID 19628817 and Bayley et al (2010), PMID 20071235), all affected family members were found to inherit a c.232G>A change in exon 2, which caused a Gly78Arg (G78R) mutation. Of note, this variant was not identified in 400 unaffected controls. **There is notable parent-of-origin effect given that the phenotype is only expressed when paternally inherited.** In both families, it is not expressed when the mutation is maternally inherited. Mulitplex-PCR for large deletions of SDHAF2 in 200 patients did not detect any deletions. (Bayley et al (2010), PMID 20071235).

A novel frameshift mutation has been reported in a patient with nonsyndromic paraganglioma and a novel truncation mutation has been reported in a patient with benign HNPGLs. Their phenotype is consistent with that of affected patients from 2 large families with a recurrent missense mutation in the same SDHAF2 gene.

**Literature review:**

SDHA, SDHAF2, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD are tumor suppressor genes. Somatic second-hit variants in tumors include gross chromosomal rearrangements, recombination, single-nucleotide variants, or epigenetic changes that result in allelic inactivation.

Affected individuals from a Dutch family described by van Baars et al [1982] were found to have a single-nucleotide change (c.232G>A) in exon 2 in SDHAF2. This resulted in a p.Gly78Arg alteration in the most conserved region of the protein and is believed to be a founder variant [Hensen et al 2012]. Of note, c.232G>C (p.Gly78Arg) has also been reported [Piccini et al 2012]. Additional loss-of-function variants have been reported in SDHAF2.

Pathogenic variants in SDHD and SDHAF2 (and possibly MAX) demonstrate parent-of-origin effects and cause disease almost exclusively when they are paternally inherited.

A study of 200 patients did not "identify any germline or somatic mutations of SDHAF2, and no gross gene deletions were noted in the subset of apparently sporadic patients analysed. Investigation of the Spanish family identified a pathogenic germline DNA mutation of SDHAF2, 232Gâ†’A (Gly78Arg), identical to the Dutch kindred."

"SDHAF2 mutations do not have an important role in phaeochromocytoma and are rare in head and neck paraganglioma. Identification of a second family with the Gly78Arg mutation suggests that this is a crucial residue for the function of SDHAF2. We conclude that SDHAF2 mutation analysis is justified in very young patients with isolated head and neck paraganglioma without mutations in SDHD, SDHC, or SDHB, and in individuals with familial antecedents who are negative for mutations in all other risk genes."

Of 972 participants in the European-American-Asian Pheochromocytoma-Paraganglioma Registry without mutations in the classic pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma susceptibility genes, 58 probands (6.0%) carried certain or likely pathogenic germline mutations that included 29 in SDHA, 20 in TMEM127, 8 in MAX, and 1 in SDHAF2.

In a large Dutch family, originally described by van Baars et al. (1982), segregating autosomal dominant paraganglioma (PGL2; 601650), Hao et al. (2009) identified a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 232 of exon 2 of the SDHAF2 gene, resulting in a gly-to-arg substitution at codon 78 (G78R). This mutation was not found in 400 unaffected control individuals and segregated with the phenotype in the family. Thirty-three individuals with the mutation had developed the disease, but not 7 individuals (median age 74 years) who had inherited the mutation from their mothers. This suggested an SDHD (602690)-like parent of origin-specific inheritance. Only 5 individuals (median age 42 years) with a paternal mutation had not developed overt paraganglioma. This reduced penetrance was thought to relate to young age and/or presence of undetected tumors.

Hensen et al. (2012) identified the Dutch founder G78R mutation in 46 cases from 4 Dutch families out of a larger cohort of 1,045 patients from 340 Dutch families with paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma.

Functional assays of SDHAF2 Gly78Arg have shown this variant results in a destabilized SDHAF2 protein and impairs SDHAF2-SDHA interaction (Hao 2009, Bezawork-Gelata 2014).

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

Although the mechanim appears to be loss of function, much of the literature on SDHAF2 is centred around a missense variant decribed in a large Dutch family. A single-nucleotide change (c.232G>A) in exon 2 in SDHAF2. From functionl studies this founder variant appears to cause destabilisation of the SDHAF2 protein and impaired SDHAF2-SDHA interaction. A study of 200 patients with paragangliomas did not identify any patients with deletions in SDHAF2 however a few loss of function variants (nonsense and frameshift) have been reported. There are 2 splicing variants on ClinVar which have been classified as likely pathogenic.
Pathogenic variants in SDHD and SDHAF2 (and possibly MAX) demonstrate parent-of-origin effects and cause disease almost exclusively when they are paternally inherited.
