PMID 10657297 - Baysal et al. 2000 describe SDHD variants in five families with hereditary paraganglioma, including two nonsense variants. The authors report that " none of the mutations has been observed in more than 200 normal control chromosomes...[and that] the mutations cosegregate with the disease phenotype in all affected individuals. "

PMID 12111639 - Cascon et al. (2002) report variants in SDHD identified in individuals with paraganglioma and/or pheochromocytoma, including one nonsense variant and one "4-bp frameshift deletion in codon 112 (13732delGACT)" that reportedly "gave rise to a 132-amino acid-truncated protein by creating a premature stop codon."

Several deletions involving SDHD have also been reported, though many of these often include adjacent genes (either in part or in their entirety). For example, McWhinney (2004) et al describe one family with a 96 kb deletion including the entire SDHD gene with a history of paraganglioma (PMID:15531530) . The authors note that this region may also include part of the adjacent TIMM8B gene. Bayley et al (2009) describe two patients with paraganglioma who are deleted for exons 1 and 2 of SDHD as well as the promoter. These deletions also included varying amounts of TIMM8B and other genes (PMID:19546167). Additionally, Caninanos et al (2011) describe one family with paraganglioma and a 25 kb deletion involving the promotor and exons 1 and 2 of SDHD, as well as 5 other genes (DLAT, PIH1D2, C11orf57, TIMM8B, SDHD) (PMID: 20310044)..

**Literature review:**

SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD are four nuclear genes responsible for hereditary PGL/PCC syndromes. They encode the four subunits of the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH).

SDHA, SDHAF2, SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD are tumor suppressor genes. Somatic second-hit variants in tumors include gross chromosomal rearrangements, recombination, single-nucleotide variants, or epigenetic changes that result in allelic inactivation.

**Nonsense, missense, and splice site variants, intragenic insertions and deletions, and a whole-gene deletion have been reported in SDHD in individuals and pedigrees with hereditary PGL/PCC syndromes. More than 70 pathogenic sequence variants have been described for SDHD (see Table A). SDHD pathogenic variants are distributed throughout the four exons of the gene.**

Pathogenic variants in SDHD result in reduced or absent succinate dehydrogenase function because of loss or dysfunction of the affected subunit or failure of the SDH heterotetramer to assemble.

No consistent genotype-phenotype correlations have been identified.

Pathogenic variants in SDHD and SDHAF2 (and possibly MAX) demonstrate parent-of-origin effects and cause disease almost exclusively when they are paternally inherited. However, a thorough family history and risk assessment should be used in determining surveillance strategies in these families regardless of suspected parent-of-origin effects.

Three hundred and forty-four probands and 436 of their relatives harboured an intragenic mutation in SDHB/SDHC/SDHD
(table 1). Forty-five intragenic mutations in 134 probands were
reported previously.10 The ratio of mutation classes among
probands was similar to that reported previously10 (44%
missense, 15% nonsense, 13% splice-site, 15% frameshift,
0.5% inframe deletions and 12% large CNAs). **There were a number of recurrent mutations, for example, SDHB splice-site
c.72+1G>Tand SDHD missense c.242C>T (p.Pro81Leu)
mutations accounted for 20% of probands,** and the 10 most
common mutations accounted for 48% (see online supplementary figure 3).

We unequivocally confirmed that SDHD mutation carriers had a
higher overall penetrance for symptomatic tumours and a higher
risk of head and neck paraganglioma (HNPGL) compared with SDHB, whereas SDHB mutation carriers had a higher risk of malignancy and were significantly more likely to develop phaeochromocytoma
and paraganglioma (PPGL).

We replicated our previous finding that SDHD p.Pro81Leu
mutation carriers manifest almost exclusively with HNPGL,
while other SDHD mutation types predispose to both HNPGLs
and PPGLs. From a clinical perspective, it can be proposed
that SDHD p.Pro81Leu mutation carriers do not need intensive imaging for PPGL

A comprehensive database of germline SDHB and SDHD
mutations is maintained at http://chromium.liacs.nl/
LOVD2/SDH/home.php (Bayley et al. 2005). A wide variety
of intragenic mutations have been described and, more
recently, single or multiple exon deletions (and, occasionally, intragenic duplications; McWhinney et al. 2004,
Cascon et al. 2008, Neumann et al. 2009). 

A number of frequent SDHB and SDHD mutations were observed and
these may result from a high mutation rate or to founder
effects. Thus the relative frequency of some mutations can
vary with geographical location. In the Netherlands, two
major SDHD founder mutations have been identified
(c.274GOT (p.Asp92Tyr) and c.416TOC (p.Leu139Pro)),
and these account for O90% of SDHD mutation carriers. A SDHD c.33C/A (p.Cys11X) founder mutation has been reported in central Europe (Poland; Peczkowska et al. 2008). The common SDHD
c.242COT (p.Pro81Leu) mutation has been reported as
both a recurrent and a founder mutation (Baysal et al.
2002). 

Homozygous SDHD mutations have been associated
with recessively inherited encephalomyopathy and mitochondrial complex II deficiency (Jackson et al. 2014).
Tumorigenesis in SDH-mutated neoplasia appears to follow
a ‘two hit’ (retinoblastoma-like) model and it has been
proposed that the parent-of-origin effects may reflect the
tendency for the ‘second hit’ causing inactivation of the WT
allele in SDHD-related tumorigenesis to be loss of the whole
chromosome 11. The imprinted gene cluster at 11p15.5
contains the maternally expressed growth suppressor
CDKN2B and the paternally expressed IGF2 growth factor
(Lim & Maher 2010). In cases of a paternally inherited
germline SDHD mutation, loss of the maternally-derived
chromosome 11 would, in a single event, result in biallelic
SDHD inactivation and loss of CDKN1C expression but preservation of IGF2 expression from the paternal allele.

SDH-mutated PPGLs show robust expression of hypoxia
induced genes, and genomic and histone hypermethylation. These effects occur in part through succinate-mediated inhibition of a-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases.
However, details of mechanisms by which SDH mutations activate hypoxic pathways and trigger subsequent neoplastic transformation remain poorly understood.

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

Deletions and loss of function mutations in SDHD are associated with paraganglioms. Pathogenic variants in SDHD result in reduced or absent succinate dehydrogenase function because of loss or dysfunction of the affected subunit or failure of the SDH heterotetramer to assemble. Details of mechanisms by which SDH mutations activate hypoxic pathways and trigger subsequent neoplastic transformation remain poorly understood. Nonsense, missense, and splice site variants, intragenic insertions and deletions, and a whole-gene deletion have been reported in SDHD. Pathogenic variants in SDHD demonstrate parent-of-origin effects and cause disease almost exclusively when they are paternally inherited. SDHD mutation carriers had a higher overall penetrance for symptomatic tumours and a higher risk of head and neck paraganglioma (HNPGL) compared with SDHB. A number of frequent SDHD mutations were observed and these may result from a high mutation rate or to founder effects. The common SDHD
c.242COT (p.Pro81Leu) mutation has been reported as
both a recurrent and a founder mutation (Baysal et al.
2002). Carriers of this particular mutation appear to manifest almost exclusively with HNPGL, while other SDHD mutation types predispose to both HNPGLs and PPGLs. Homozygous SDHD mutations have been associated with recessively inherited encephalomyopathy and mitochondrial complex II deficiency.
