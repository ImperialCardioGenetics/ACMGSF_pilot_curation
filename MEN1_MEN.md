Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a complex syndrome defined by the neoplastic transformation of at least two endocrine organs, most frequently parathyroid glands, pancreatic islets, anterior pituitary and endocrine pancreas. There is abundant evidence published associating the MEN1 gene with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, since the gene-disease relationship was first proposed by Chandrasekharappa SC, et al., 1997 (PMID: 9103196). Multiple case level studies have been performed with MEN1 patients that have variants in the MEN1 gene. The variants include single amino acid changes or deletions that affect the stability of the protein and nonsense or frameshift LOF variants. A significant amount of case-level data is available; the maximum points for genetic evidence has been reached (12 points). Multiple mouse models of MEN1 have been established to show development of tumors consistent with MEN1 syndrome. In summary, MEN1 is definitively associated with the autosomal autosomal dominant Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 syndrome. This has been demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings and has been upheld over time.

**MEN1 sequence level variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site, and exonic deletions) as well as non-focal MEN1 whole gene deletions are associated with the development of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome (PMID: 9510467, 15105049, and 21763627 and Genereviews).** MEN1 syndrome is characterized by an increased susceptibility to develop endocrine tumors (i.e., parathryoid, pituitary, and well-differentiated endocrine tumors of the gastro-entero-pancreatic [GEP] tract), as well as non-endocrine tumors (e.g. facial angiofibromas, collagenomas, lipomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, and leiomyomas). The penetrance for the development of clinical features associated with MEN1 mutations is 50% by age 20 and 95% by age 40.

**Literature review:**

**More than 1,200 germline mutations in the MEN1 gene have been identified, which are scattered over the entire coding region of the gene without any significant hot spots or genotype-phenotype correlations (27, 29).** The majority of MEN1 germline mutations (69%) are predicted to be pathogenic due to either premature truncation of menin due to frame-shift mutations (42%) and nonsense mutations (14%), or exon region deletions which are attributed to splicing defects (10.5%) and large deletions (2.5%) (27, 29). Other MEN1 germline mutations include missense mutations (25.5%) and single or few amino acid in-frame deletions or insertions (5.5%), which require further investigation to determine their pathogenicity.

**Approximately 5–25% of patients with MEN1 may not have mutations in the MEN1 coding region. These individuals may have whole or partial gene deletions,** and it has been postulated that mutations may also occur in the promoter or untranslated regions (27, 30, 31). In addition, the occurrence of phenocopies, or patients that develop disease manifestations typically associated with mutations in the MEN1 gene but instead are due to another etiology, has been described in 5–10% of MEN1 kindreds (32–34). These phenocopies may occur in individuals with a family history of MEN1 and one MEN1-associated tumor or in patients with two MEN1-associated tumors with other gene involvement.

Germline MEN1 mutations have also been noted in families with a parathyroid only disorder, familial isolated primary hyperparathyroidism, where there is a higher frequency of missense mutations compared to patients with the MEN1 syndrome 

MEN1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Patients with germline inactivating mutations in MEN1 demonstrate loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in more than 90% of their tumors.

The protein product of MEN1, menin, is implicated in the regulation of transcription, genome stability, cell division, and cell proliferation, though the exact role of menin in tumorigenesis is yet to be elucidated (1, 27, 28, 42).

Two main nuclear localization signals (NLS), NLS1 and NLS2, as well as a third accessory NLS, NLSa, are harbored within the amino acid sequence of menin (43, 44). Mutations in MEN1 that lead to premature protein truncation may lead to functional inactivation of menin through loss of one or both main NLSs. Menin has not been demonstrated to have intrinsic enzymatic activity, but studies of protein-protein interaction by multiple groups have identified more than 50 proteins that could partner with menin

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

MEN1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene. The protein product of MEN1, menin, is implicated in the regulation of transcription, genome stability, cell division, and cell proliferation, though the exact role of menin in tumorigenesis is yet to be elucidated. Patients with germline inactivating mutations in MEN1 demonstrate loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in more than 90% of their tumors. Pathogenic variants are spread throughout the gene with no clear hot spot regions. The majority of variants are predicted to be pathogenic due to either premature truncation of menin due to frame-shift mutations (42%) and nonsense mutations (14%), or exon region deletions which are attributed to splicing defects (10.5%) and large deletions (2.5%). Approximately 5–25% of patients with MEN1 may not have mutations in the MEN1 coding region. These individuals may have whole or partial gene deletions, or mutations may occur in the promoter or untranslated regions.
