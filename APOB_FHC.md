The APOB gene has been reported in association with hypercholesterolemia (autosomal dominant) and hypobetalipoproteinemia (autosomal recessive). The relationship between APOB and hypercholesterolemia (autosomal dominant) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework. Variants in APOB were first reported in humans with hypercholesterolemia as early as 1989 (Soria et al., PMID: 2563166). **At least 7 variants (missense) in at least 13 probands in 6 publications been reported in humans** (PMIDs: 24498611, 24234650, 15135245, 22408029, 2563166, 7627691). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 41 family members. This gene-disease relationship has been studied in at least 1 case-control study at the single variant level with an odds ratio of 78 (95% CI 16-388, p=0.0001) (PMID: 9603795). **The mechanism for disease involves mainly heterozygous missense variants resulting in defective apo B100 on LDL particles that fails to bind to LDLR (PMID: 29219151).** The gene-disease association is also supported by in vitro studies and animal models. In summary, APOB is definitively associated with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation EP on 11/14/2018.

**Literature review:**

"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is the major apolipoprotein on lipoprotein molecules, especially LDL-C, and functions as a ligand to the LDL-receptor. The gene is located on chromosome 2p and spans more than 43 kb. The gene comprises 29 exons and is transcribed and translated into a protein of 4563 amino acids [14]. While truncation mutations in the APOB gene cause hypobetalipoproteinemia, **mutations causing hypercholesterolaemia are due to missense mutations** that result in ligand-defective apoB protein. The LDL-C particles made from this allele are therefore not able to bind to the LDL-receptor and thus accumulate in the blood [15]. A single mutation of the APOB gene (p.Arg3527Gln) accounts for approximately 6–10% of all FH cases in European population, and it is located in exon 26 of APOB gene [16]. Other APOB mutations in other regions of the gene such as p.Arg50Trp, p.Arg1164Thr and p.Gln4494del were also recently found to cause FH..."

"Familial hypercholesterolemia-2 (FHCL2; 144010) is caused by mutation in APOB causing decreased LDLR (606945) binding affinity, so-called familial ligand-defective apolipoprotein B. The first mutation of this sort was described by Soria et al. (1989); see 107730.0009. A second was described by Pullinger et al. (1995)..."

"...More than five pathogenic variants have been reported to be associated with FH, two of which are repeatedly found to be significant:

- p.Arg3527Gln, found mainly in people with European ancestry

- p.Arg3527Trp, which tends to be found mostly within Asian populations [Calandra et al 2011]

Pathogenic variants in this locus account for approximately 1%-5% of all persons with FH. APOB is generally involved in aiding the binding of LDL-C to its receptor on the cell surface. APOB pathogenic variants alter the ability of protein to effectively bind LDL-C to LDLR, causing fewer LDL-C particles to be removed from the blood."

"FH caused by a heterozygous APOB pathogenic variant is reported to be less severe than FH caused by a heterozygous pathogenic variant in LDLR or PCSK9 [Hopkins et al 2011]...

Penetrance for FH can be incomplete in persons with a heterozygous APOB pathogenic variant [Fahed & Nemer 2011]...

Homozygous or heterozygous loss-of-function pathogenic variants in APOB cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (OMIM 615558) characterized by extremely low levels of LDL-C [Burnett et al 2012]."

**Disease associated variant consequences:**

Altered gene product structure

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

The mechanism appears to be missense mutations resulting in an **Altered gene product** which leads to defective APOB protein causing LDL-C particles to accumulate in the blood. Penetrance is incomplete and there are recurrent mutations identified in different populations. A single mutation of the APOB gene (p.Arg3527Gln) accounts for approximately 6–10% of all FH cases in European population, and it is located in exon 26 of APOB gene.
