The DSP gene was the first ARVC-gene to be associated to the disease, the initial mutation description was done in Carvajal syndrome characterized by woolly hair, keratoderma and ARVC, it is transmitted in a autosomal recessive pattern, homozygous mutations in DSP were described in in the year 2000, PMID 11063735. This was followed by the description of a heterozygous mutation in DSP in an Italian family with ARVC and clear co-segregation of the variant with the disease, PMID 12373648. These findings have been replicated worldwide in several studies performed in different ethnicities, PMID 15941723, PMID 25765472, PMID 23954618, PMID 20864495, PMID 21397041, PMID 24938629.

The initial descriptions recognized also a high frequency of left
ventricular compromise in families with DSP mutations, PMID 16061754, PMID 28527814. A murine model was generated able to replicate the arrhythmia phenotype and Cx43 mislocalization, PMID 22240500. A transgenic mouse overexpressing a mutant DSP had increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis and lipid accumulation PMID 16917092.
Abnormal DSP protein expression in DSP mutation carriers has also been reported, PMID 23137101. The role of this gene in this particular disease has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time (in general,at least 3 years). No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the role of the gene in the specified disease. In summary, based on this overwhelming evidence, DSP is definitely associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with woolly hair and keratoderma, maximum association score was achieved rapidly after the analysis of few main reports.

**ClinGen Haploinsufficiency phenotype comments:**

The desmosomal cardiomyopathies are often associated with a complex mode of inheritance and a highly variable pattern of protein expression. AR inheritance form mutations are often ?loss of function? mutations and AD forms are known to occur. However, there is no clear evidence that they are due to haploinsufficiency; dominant negative effect appears to be
the more likely mechanism of pathogenicity in these cases. Furthermore, whole gene deletions have not been reported in the literature. At most, haploinsuffiency may result in skin manifestations (hereditary palmoplantar keratoderma) or may contribute in a multifactorial manner to susceptibility to heart disease

**Literature review:**

DSP is the largest among the desmosome genes and encodes the 2872 amino acid protein, desmoplakin. The N-terminus of desmoplakin is required for localization to the desmosome and interaction with plakophilin and plakoglobin. The C-terminus of desmoplakin binds to the intermediate filaments (desmin)...
A DSP mutation was first identified in a homozygous manner as the cause of Carvajal disease, which shows dilated cardiomyopathy with wooly hair and keratoedema...

In 2002, a DSP mutation, S229R, was identified in a 18 year-old male who suffered cardiac arrest and was diagnosed with
ARVC. An extended clinical and genetic analysis of his family members from 4 generation confirmed that the mutation was the cause of ARVC. The residue 229 located in the N-terminus of desmoplakin is involved in binding with plakoglobin or plakophilin, and the mutation S229R would disrupt the normal binding with those proteins.

After the first report, other DSP mutations have been identified in ARVC patients. Although DSP is the largest among the desmosome genes, the number of reported mutations is small compared to other genes. Only 12 mutations have been reported in recent study with 439 families.

More than 80 pathogenic variants have been described (see Table A, Locus Specific). In addition, multiple instances of digenic inheritance have been identified with other desmosomal gene mutations [Rigato et al 2013, Groeneweg et al 2015].

It is speculated that abnormalities in desmoplakin lead to desmosomal instability. Defective desmosomes cannot sustain the constant mechanical stress in contracting cardiomyocytes, resulting in cardiac dysfunction and cell death [Yang et al 2006].

Data from a desmoplakin-deficient mouse model suggest that abnormal desmosomes lead to abnormal β-catenin signaling through Tcf-Lef1 transcription factors resulting in de-differentiation of myocytes into adipocytes [Garcia-Gras et al 2006]. Conditional deletion of Dsp using the Hcn4-Cre allele, which deleted Dsp in the cardiac conduction system, resulted in sinus node dysfunction, underscoring the importance of desmosomes for cardiac conduction system integrity [Mezzano et al 2016].

"an amino-terminal region of DSP encompassing three of the predicted alpha-helical bundles Z, Y, and X (residues 250 through 604) contained 8/17 (47%) of the DSP missense mutations found in ARVC cases compared to 1/28 (3.6%) of the DSP missense mutations found in controls (*P* \< 0.0008, [Figure 6A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6311127/figure/F6/))."

**our data support the notion that there are no differences in terms of arrhythmic risk between missense and non-missense DSP mutations in ARVC.**

We show that ARVC-associated DSP mutations correlate with a high
arrhythmic risk and that non-missense mutations are specifically
associated with left-dominant forms. **The presence of DSP truncating mutations should alert to the likely development of LV dysfunction.**

*Castelletti S et al. 2017 Dec 15 (PMID:28527814)*

Here, we found that DSP cardiomyopathy involves the LV in almost all cases and often without any apparent RV involvement. This finding was in clear contrast to PKP2 cardiomyopathy, which always involved the RV predominantly and most often in isolation. Not surprisingly, the ARVC task force criteria, validated primarily in PKP2-enriched cohorts, performed poorly for detection of clinically affected DSP probands and nonprobands.

In a mutation analysis of 66 probands with ARVD, [Yang et al.
(2006)](https://www.omim.org/entry/125647#31) identified 4 variants in DSP: V30M, Q90R, W233X, and R2834H ([125647.0012](https://www.omim.org/entry/125647#0012)). To establish a
cause and effect relationship between these DSP missense mutations and ARVD, they performed in vitro and in vivo analyses of the mutant proteins. **Unlike wildtype DSP, the N-terminal mutants (V30M and Q90R) failed to localize to the cell membrane in a desmosome-forming cell line and failed to bind to and coimmunoprecipitate junction plakoglobin.**

Multiple attempts to generate N-terminal DSP (V30M and Q90R)
cardiac-specific transgenes failed; analysis of embryos revealed
evidence of profound ventricular dilation, which likely resulted in embryonic lethality. [Yang et al. (2006) PMID 16917092](https://www.omim.org/entry/125647#31) were able to develop transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-restricted overexpression of the C-terminal mutant (R2834H) or wildtype DSP. Whereas mice overexpressing
wildtype DSP had no detectable histologic, morphologic, or functional cardiac changes, the R2834H-Tg mice had increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis, and lipid accumulation, along with ventricular enlargement and cardiac dysfunction in both ventricles.
These mice also displayed interruption of DSP-desmin interaction at intercalated discs and marked ultrastructural changes of these discs.
**The data suggested that DSP expression in cardiomyocytes is crucial for maintaining cardiac tissue integrity, and that DSP abnormalities result in ARVD by cardiomyocyte death, changes in lipid metabolism, and defects in cardiac development**

.... 4 patients with mutations in the DSP gene, 3 ARVD patients and 1 patient with Carvajal syndrome. The mutation carriers had abnormal DSP expression in both myocardial and epidermal tissue; disease mechanisms included haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative effects, or both.

"Mutations in the DSP gene encoding desmoplakin were first identified in an autosomal recessive form of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. The present study makes a case for DSP cardiomyopathy being a distinct form of cardiomyopathy. DSP cardiomyopathy results in episodic inflammation, which precedes the development of fibrosis. Frequent PVCs occurring before LV systolic dysfunction or LV enlargement is also a key distinction from most cases of DCM. In DSP patients, late gadolinium enhancement was found in the LV subepicardium rather than mid-myocardial as is often seen with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. The correct diagnosis must include the identification of the DSP mutation. This paper is likely to be very impactful, as it suggests that some of the patients suspected of myocarditis and cardiac sarcoidosis may actually have DSP cardiomyopathy.

Mutations in this study were primarily truncating mutations (ie, frameshift, nonsense, or splice site
mutations). Truncating mutations in this and other
studies occur throughout the gene without evident
clustering. **There was no clear correlation between
truncating mutation location and clinical presentation.** These findings indicate a similar loss of function consequence of DSP truncating mutations through nonsense mediated RNA decay of mutant
transcripts, rather than effects from truncated proteins,
consistent with reduced DSP protein levels in skin and
myocardium from patients with DSP truncating mutations.18,30 

The specific mutation location may contribute
to the disease phenotype in the case of missense mutations (eg, mutations in the desmin versus plakophilin/
plakoglobin binding domains), but this study did not include enough missense mutation carriers to analyze this
relationship. Supporting this concept, a previous case
series of 10 patients with missense mutations versus
17 patients with truncating mutations found that the
former were less likely to have LV dysfunction.28 Also
suggesting the possibility of locus-specific effects for
missense variants is the evidence of mutation clustering in the plakophilin/plakoglobin-binding and desmin binding protein domains..

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

The initial mutation description in DSP was done in Carvajal syndrome characterized by woolly hair, keratoderma and ARVC. This was followed by the description of a heterozygous mutation in DSP in an Italian family with ARVC and clear co-segregation of the variant with the disease. The disease mechanism is not clear and haploinsufficiency, dominant negative or both have all been proposed as mechanisms leading to **reduction/absence of gene product or altered gene product structure** in DSP. It is speculated that abnormalities in desmoplakin lead to desmosomal instability. Defective desmosomes cannot sustain the constant mechanical stress in contracting cardiomyocytes, resulting in cardiac dysfunction and cell death.
One study suggested that ARVC-associated DSP mutations correlate with a high arrhythmic risk and the presence of truncating mutations should alert to the likely development of LV dysfunction. Smith E et al 2020 have suggested that DSP mutations are associated with a distinct type of cardiomyopathy with a high prevalence of LV inflammation, fibrosis, and systolic dysfunction, and DSP cardiomyopathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis for myocarditis and sarcoidosis. **These authors suggest a loss of function consequence of DSP truncating mutations through nonsense mediated RNA decay of mutant transcripts,** rather than effects from truncated proteins, consistent with reduced DSP protein levels in skin and myocardium from patients with DSP. They did not find a clear correlation between truncating mutation location and clinical presentation, however the study did not include enough missense mutation carriers to analyze this for missense mutations. They suggest that as there seems to be mutation clustering in the plakophilin/plakoglobin-binding and desmin binding protein domains there could be a locus specific effect for missense variants. Although missense mutations are reported, pathogenic truncating mutations appear to be more common. One study reported that the amino-terminal region of DSP (residues 250 through 604) contained 8/17 (47%) of the DSP missense mutations found in ARVC cases compared to 1/28 (3.6%) found in controls.

There have been reports of digenic inheritance with other desomosomal mutations.
