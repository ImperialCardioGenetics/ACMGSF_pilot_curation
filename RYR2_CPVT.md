**ClinGen Haploinsufficiency comments:**

The RYR2 gene encodes the cardiac ryanodine receptor that regulates contraction by the intracellular release of calcium and plays and essential rolein excitation-contraction in the heart (PMID: 24743769) . **Pathogenic changes that result in gain-of-function of the RYR2 gene have reported in individuals with several types of tachyarrhythmias, including catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)**, catecholaminergic idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation and a structurally normal heart (Napolitano et al., 2014). Loss of function variants have not been associated with RYR2-related disorders. An in-frame deletion of exon 3 has been reported in patients with CPVT and other arrhythmias, however the pathogenetic mechanism has not been well defined (PMID: 24743769).

**Literature review:**

The main gene responsible for up to 50% of CPVT cases is RyR2, which encodes for the cardiac isoform of the ryanodine receptor. RyR2 mediates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, required for sarcomere contraction. **Genetic alterations in the RyR2 gene increases calcium release and can trigger life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias under catecholaminergic stimulation**

Four different single nucleotide substitutions leading to hRyR2 missense mutations (nonconservative amino acid changes) were identified in the 4 probands with catecholaminergic VT.

"RyR2 mutations appear to be preferentially located in four regions (Figure 3). The term “domains” indicates those regions, according to this classification, domain I includes amino acids 77 to 466, domain II amino acids 2246–2534 , domain III amino acids 3778–4201 and domain IV amino acids 4497–4959 (Figure 4). These regions are highly conserved in RyR across species and are superimposable (except for region III) to the localization of RyR1 mutations associated with central core disease and malignant hyperthermia (47)...analysis of our CPVT cohort by direct ORF sequencing indicates that 24% of RyR2 mutations identified in CPVT patients are located outside the four canonical domains."

"...observations indicate that CPVT RyR2 mutations preferentially sensitize the channel to luminal Ca2+ activation, while only a few CPVT RyR2 mutations sensitize the channel to both cytosolic and luminal Ca2+ activation."

"Premature stop codons, frameshifts, and out-of-frame insertions or deletions **have not** been identified in CPVT patients screened for mutation on the RYR2 gene."

**"We have identified 82 RYR2 mutations in our CPVT probands: 79 were point mutations and 3 (3.6%) were small deletions/insertions (one in frame insertion and two in frame deletions).** Small in-frame duplications or in-frame insertions (48,53) are present in patients with the CPVT phenotype, suggesting that their functional consequences are similar to that of point mutations, rendering the channel more prone to spontaneous SR Ca2+ release during adrenergic stimulation."

More than 150 RYR2 pathogenic variants causing CPVT have been reported to date [Priori & Chen 2011]. Sequencing of the entire coding region and flanking intronic regions is optimal, as 24% of pathogenic variants are located outside of the regions encoding the KBP12.6-binding region, the calcium-binding domain, and the transmembrane domain (C-terminus) [Priori & Chen 2011].

No mutation hot spots have been reported to date.

Exon-spanning deletions have been reported [Marjamaa et al 2009, Medeiros-Domingo et al 2009, Campbell et al 2015, Leong et al 2015].

The mean penetrance of RYR2 pathogenic variants is 83% [Author, unpublished data]. Therefore, asymptomatic individuals with RYR2-related CPVT are a minority.

**Disease associated variant consequences:**

Altered gene product structure

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

Mechanism is likely gain of function through **altered gene product structure** causing increased RYR2 channel sensitivity to Ca2+ activation and increased spontaneous calcium release. The majority of the pathogenic variants are missense. Premature stop codons, frameshifts, and out-of-frame insertions or deletions **have not** been identified in CPVT patients. Exon-spanning deletions have been reported. Sequencing of the entire coding region and flanking intronic regions is optimal, as 24% of pathogenic variants are located outside of the regions encoding the KBP12.6-binding region, the calcium-binding domain, and the transmembrane domain (C-terminus). Penetrance is high, estimated by the authors of gene reviews at approximately 80%.
