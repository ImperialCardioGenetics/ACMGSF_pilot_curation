Wilms tumor is the most common renal tumor of childhood, occurring with an incidence of 1 in 10,000 and with a median age of diagnosis between 3 and 4 years of age. Wilms tumours are thought to develop from abnormally persistent embryonal cells within nephrogenic rests (PMID: 19948536). The WT1 gene encodes a zinc finger DNA-binding protein that acts as a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on the cellular or chromosomal context (PMID: 1127846). The relationship between WT1 and Wilms tumor type 1 (autosomal dominant) was first reported in 1991 (Pelletier et al., PMID: 1654525). Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data and experimental data. Seven variants (nonsense, frameshift) in this gene reported in at least 8 probands in 3 publications (PMIDs: 15483024, 1654525, 18688870) are included in this curation. More evidence is available in the literature, but the maximum score for genetic evidence (12 pts.) has been reached. This gene-disease association is also supported by expression studies, cell culture and mouse models (PMIDs: 2164159, 26035382, 21123950, 14645201). Per criteria outlined by the ClinGen Lumping and Splitting Working Group, **we found differences in molecular mechanism and phenotypic variability between Wilms tumor type 1 and congenital malformation syndromes associated with WT1 variants (Denys-Drash syndrome, Frasier syndrome, Meacham syndrome, and nephrotic syndrome, type 4). For example, many individuals with Denys-Drash syndrome harbor heterozygous missense variants in exon 8 or 9 and may act in a dominant-negative manner (Royer-Pokora et al., 2004; PMID: 15150775), while the majority of variants reported for Wilms tumor type 1 are loss-of-function variants.** Therefore, we have split curations for WT1 into Wilms tumor type 1 and congenital malformation syndromes associated with variants in WT1. **In summary, loss of function variants in WT1 are definitively associated with autosomal dominant Wilms tumor type 1.** This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.

**ClinGen Evidence for Haploinsufficiency**
Deletions and loss of function mutations are associated with increased risk for Wilms tumor with or without genitourinary malformations and/or renal failure. See Gene Reviews and Royer-Pokora (2004) PMID:15150775 for review. Large deletions that also encompass the PAX6 gene lead to WAGR syndrome (Wilms tumor-aniridia-genital anomalies-retardation). There are also many heterozygous missense mutations described that may act in a dominant negative manner that lead to a spectrum of clinical phenotypes including Denys-Drash syndrome, Frasier syndrome, Meacham syndrome, and Nephrotic syndrome type 4.

**Literature review:**

Only patients with exon mutations developed WT. Twelve of 36 (33%) with missense mutation and seven of eight (88%) with truncating mutations developed WT; no significant difference between mutations in DNA-binding or non–DNA-binding regions was observed. Patients with missense mutation were diagnosed at a median age of 1.3 (IQR, 1–1.8) years, patients with a truncating mutation at 1 (IQR, 0.8–1.3 months) (P=0.2). Bilateral WT occurred in five of seven (71%) patients with truncating mutations and two of 12 (17%) patients with missense mutations (P=0.04).

**we observed a much higher frequency (52%) of bilateral tumors in patients carrying truncation mutations...**
The reduced frequency of bilateral tumors in patients carrying missense mutations compared with truncation mutations cannot be due to a difference in the mechanism of inactivating the second allele, however, and may be due to the function of the mutant protein. Most patients with missense mutations were described as having DDS, consistent withprevious reports of a predominance of WT1 missense muta-tions in DDS patients [Huff, 1996; Jeanpierre et al., 1998;Schumacher et al., 1998]. 

There were only three patients with characterized splice site mutations and all developed unilateral tumors. In all three cases no normal transcript was seen in the tumors[Royer-Pokora and Schumacher, in press; Schneider et al.,1993; Sakamoto et al., 2001].

*Royer-Pokora (2004) (PMID:15150775)*

Schumacher et al. (1997) identified 19 hemizygous WT1 gene mutations/deletions in tissue samples from 64 patients...Of the patients with germline alterations, 6 had associated genitourinary (GU) tract malformations and a unilateral tumor, 2 had a bilateral tumor and normal GU tracts, and 2 had a unilateral tumor and normal GU tracts. Three mutations were tumor-specific and were found in patients with unilateral tumors without genital tract abnormalities. These data demonstrated the correlation of WT1 mutations with stromal-predominant histology, suggesting that a germline mutation in WT1 predisposes to the development of tumors with this histology. Twelve mutations were nonsense mutations resulting in truncation at different positions in the WT1 protein, and only 2 were missense mutations. Of the stromal-predominant tumors, 67% showed loss of heterozygosity, and in 1 tumor a different somatic mutation in addition to the germline mutation was identified. **Thus, in a large proportion of a histopathologically distinct subset of Wilms tumors, the classic 2-hit inactivation model, with loss of a functional WT1 protein, is the underlying cause of tumor development.**

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

The mechanism appears to be loss of function of WT1 resulting in **decreased/absent or altered gene product** which leads to a predisposition to Wilms tumour. The majority of variants reported in association with Wilms tumour type 1 are loss-of-function variants whereas many individuals with congenital malformation syndromes (e.g. Denys-Drash syndrome) harbor heterozygous missense variants in exon 8 or 9 which may act in a dominant-negative manner. Truncating mutations appear to cause a higher frequency of bilateral tumours than missense mutations.
