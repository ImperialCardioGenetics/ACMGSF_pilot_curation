The relationship between PCSK9 and familial hypercholesterolemia (autosomal dominant) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of November 14, 2018. Variants in PCSK9 were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 2003 (Abifadel et al., PMID: 12730697). **At least 15 variants (missense) have been reported in humans.** Evidence supporting this gene-disease relationship includes case-level data, segregation data, and experimental data. **Variants in this gene have been reported in at least 17 probands in 6 publications (PMIDs: 12730697, 15772090, 22683120, 26541928, 29127338, 20006333). Variants in this gene segregated with disease in at least 31 family members. The mechanism for disease is heterozygous gain of function (Maxwell et al., 2005; PMID: 16577715), while heterozygous loss of function variants are associated with low levels of LDL cholesterol** (Cohen et al., 2005, PMID: 15654334). This gene-disease association is supported by animal models, expression studies, and in vitro functional assays. In summary, PCSK9 is definitively associated with autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time.

**ClinGen evidence for haploinsufficiency**

Nonsense mutations in PCSK9 appear to be polymorphic and confer susceptibility to low LDL cholesterol (hypocholesterolemia) whereas dominant missense mutations predispose to high LDL cholesterol. There are also multiple reports of deletion CNVs at or near (and could be extending into depending on array resolution) PCSK9 in DGV. There are many PCSK9 frameshift and stop gain changes listed in ExAc (one at high frequency = 33 alleles = p.Tyr142Ter, rs67608943).

**Literature review:**

"we have shown that overexpression of PCSK9 in HepG2 cells leads to accelerated degradation of the LDLR by a nonproteasomal mechanism in a post-ER, pH-sensitive compartment...It is also not clear why PCSK9 overexpression in mice results in a similar phenotype to humans carrying PCSK9 missense mutations. The simplest interpretation is that these are gain-of-function mutations..."

*Maxwell KN et al. 2005 Feb 8 (PMID:15677715)*

**"In 2003, gain-of-function mutations in a third gene, encoding for PCSK9, were identified as a cause of FH *Abifadel M et al. 2003 Jun (PMID:12730697)*.** PCSK9, when forming a complex with the LDLR, is internalized by modification of the LDLR confirmation and interferes with LDLR recycling. This leads to LDLR degradation and therefore reduction of the amount of receptors available at the hepatocyte surface to bind circulating LDL particles"

*Hartgers M et al 2015 (PMID: 26482752)*

"Missense mutations in PCSK9 that cause a gain-of-function lead to a rare form of FH. Loss-of-function in certain ethnic populations has been shown to result in lower LDL-C levels and protect against CHD [28]."

*Henderson R et al 2016 (PMID: 27084339)*

The PCSK9 protein product binds to LDL lipid receptors and promotes their degradation in intracellular acidic compartments.

Pathogenic variants in this gene have been associated both with hypercholesterolemia and hypocholesterolemia.

**Gain-of-function pathogenic variants cause hypercholesterolemia by excessive degradation of LDLRs, reducing the amount of LDL-C removed from the blood.**

Loss-of-function pathogenic variants cause hypocholesterolemia (reduced blood cholesterol levels) by increasing the number of LDLRs on the surface of liver cells, resulting in a quicker than usual removal of LDL-C from the blood and reduced incidence of coronary artery disease [Cohen et al 2006, Pandit et al 2008].

Penetrance is approximately 90% in persons heterozygous for the c.381T>A (p.Ser127Arg) pathogenic variant.
Penetrance in persons heterozygous for the p.Asp374Tyr pathogenic variant is high, with FH manifesting at a young age [Naoumova et al 2005].
Penetrance for other heterozygous PCSK9 pathogenic variants remains largely unknown [Cariou et al 2011].

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

The mechanism appears to be missense variants causing gain of function of PCSK9 resulting in an **altered gene product** which leads to excessive degradation of LDLRs, reducing the amount of LDL-C removed from the blood. Loss-of-function pathogenic variants cause hypocholesterolemia (reduced blood cholesterol levels) by increasing the number of LDLRs on the surface of liver cells. Penetrance is approximately 90% in persons heterozygous for the c.381T>A (p.Ser127Arg) pathogenic variant. Penetrance in persons heterozygous for the p.Asp374Tyr pathogenic variant is high, with FH manifesting at a young age [Naoumova et al 2005]. Penetrance for other heterozygous PCSK9 pathogenic variants remains largely unknown [Cariou et al 2011].
