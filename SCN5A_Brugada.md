**ClinGen Haploinsufficiency Comments:**

SCN5A encodes a subunit (type V, alpha) of a voltage-gated sodium channel protein that functions in cardiac muscle to regulate conduction. More than 600 SCN5A variants have been reported in association with cardiac channelopathy phenotypes.

Heterozygous sequence-level mutations in SCN5A are associated with a number of cardiovascular abnormalities including Brugada syndrome, cardiac conduction disease (CCD), long QT syndrome type 3 (LQT3), atrial fibrillation, and sick sinus syndrome (SSS). Functional studies (patch clamp assays, cellular localization studies, and western blots) have been performed on a number of the reported mutations; however, these studies have been done in in vitro models and it is unknown whether these mutations would have the same functional consequence in vivo. To this point, one study on SCN5A variants stated that ?caution should be taken when extrapolating the findings from the in vitro study of HEK293 cells and oocytes to the more complex in vivo conditions? (Gui et al. 2010).

**Based on the functional studies mentioned above, SCN5A loss-of-function-type mutations have been associated with Brugada syndrome,** CCD, and SSS, while SCN5A gain-of-function-type mutations have been associated with LQT3 (Hong et al., 2005; Makiyama et al., 2005; Zimmer and Surber, 2008; Kapplinger et al. 2010; Eastaugh et al., 2011; Remme 2013). Both loss-of-function and gain-of-function-type mutations of SCN5A have been identified in association with atrial fibrillation (Remme, 2013). Incomplete penetrance for some of the SCN5A mutant phenotypes has also been observed (Cordeiro et al., 2006; Makita et al., 2007; Eastaugh et al., 2011).

Although there are a number of SCN5A mutations that are reported to be associated with loss-of-function-type mechanism (Tfelt-Hansen et al. 2009), the SCN5A genotype/phenotype association is still not well understood as there are several mutations that have been associated with both Brugada syndrome (loss-of-function) and LQT3 (gain-of-function) (Zimmer and Surber et al., 2008; Blich et al. 2015). Due to the clinical heterogeneity, mutational spectrum, and lack of reports of whole gene deletions, the haploinsufficiency score is a 1.

**Literature review:**

The *SCN5A* gene encodes the alpha subunit of the main cardiac sodium channel Na~v~1.5. This channel predominates inward sodium current (INa) and plays a critical role in regulation of cardiac electrophysiological function. INa mediated by Nav1.5 can be classified into peak and late sodium currents (INa-P and INa-L). Mutations of SCN5A can impair Nav1.5 function and change the magnitude and duration of INa-P and INa-L, consequently leading to different types of fatal arrhythmias.

*Han et al 2018 (PMID: 29806494)*

"Original Brugada paper identified a missense mutation, an insertion of AA disrupting splice donor sequence, and single base deletion causing an in frame stop codon in exon 1. Missense mutation appeared to lead to altered SCN5A function whilst the latter 2 mutations were predicted to cause loss of function."

*Chen Q et al. 1998 Mar 19 (PMID:9521325)*

**Another study described 293 distinct mutations in SCN5A: 193 missense, 32 nonsense, 38 frameshift, 21 splice-site, and 9 in-frame deletions/insertions.** The 4 most frequent BrS1-associated mutations were E1784K (14), F861WfsX90 (11), D356N (8), and G1408R (7). Most mutations localized to the transmembrane-spanning regions.

*Kapplinger JD et al 2010 (PMID: 20129283)*

Over 300 SCN5A loss-of-function mutations have been identified in
connection with BrS. Misfolded channels, trafficking defects, and
negatively shifted steady-state inactivation curves contribute to a reduced availability of functional Nav1.5 channels on the plasma
membrane.

*Han et al 2018
(PMID: [29806494]; Schulze-Bahr et al 2003 (PMID: 14961552); Mizusawa et al 2012 (PMID: 22715240)*

To note, gain of function mutations in SCN5A have been linked to other cardiac phenotypes and loss of function and gain of function mutations can co-exist and have been linked to an overlapping phenotype.

Altered gene product structure

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

Mechanism likely loss of function of SCN5A due to **reduction/absence of gene product or altered gene product** due to a variety of mechanisms (e.g. null alleles, misfolded channels, trafficking defects, and negatively shifted steady-state inactivation curves contribute to a reduced availability of functional Nav1.5 channels on the plasma membrane.) One study described 293 distinct mutations in SCN5A: 193 missense, 32 nonsense, 38 frameshift, 21 splice-site, and 9 in-frame deletions/insertions. The 4 most frequent BrS1-associated mutations were E1784K, F861WfsX90, D356N, and G1408R. Most mutations localized to the transmembrane-spanning regions. To note gain of function mutations have been reported in association with Long QT syndrome. Although loss of function appears to be the mechanism in Brugada the SCN5A genotype/phenotype association is still not completely understood.
