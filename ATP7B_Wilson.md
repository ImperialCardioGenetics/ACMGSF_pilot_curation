The relationship between ATP7B and Wilson disease (autosomal recessive) was evaluated using the ClinGen Clinical Validity Framework as of March 26th, 2019. Variants in ATP7B were first reported in humans with this disease as early as 1993 (Bull et al., PMID 8298639). Wilson disease is a disorder of copper metabolism characterized by an accumulation of copper in many organs, particularly the liver and brain. **At least 700 unique germline variants have been identified (missense, nonsense, splice site, frameshift)** (reviewed in Członkowska et al., 2018; PMID 30190489). This gene-disease relationship is well-known and therefore a significant amount of case-level data, segregation data and experimental data is available in the literature, therefore the maximum score for both genetic evidence and experimental evidence has been reached. Note, this curation effort may not be exhaustive of all literature related to this gene-disease relationship. **The mutational mechanism for disease is loss of function leading to reduced (or absent) copper-transporter activity (Huster et al., 2012; PMID 22240481).** This gene-disease association is supported by expression studies, in vitro functional assays, and animal models. In summary, ATP7B is definitively associated with autosomal recessive Wilson disease. This has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time. This classification was approved by the ClinGen General Gene Curation Expert Panel on March 27, 2019.

**Literature review:**

More than 700 mutations have been described according to The Human Gene Mutation Database16,17 and patients can be homozygous for one disease-causing mutation or carry two different disease-causing mutations as compound heterozygotes. Mutations can affect almost all 21 exons and are frequently missense and nonsense. The missense mutation H1069Q in exon 14 is very common. About 50–80% of WD patients from Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe carry at least one allele with the H1069Q mutation2. In Southern Europe, other mutations are common, such as the missense mutation M645R in mainland Spain. The R778L in exon 8 is found more frequently in South-eastern Asia where the mutation has an allele frequency of 14 to 49%2.

The product of ATP7B is copper-transporting ATPase 2, an intracellular transmembrane copper transporter that is key in incorporating copper into ceruloplasmin and in moving copper out of the hepatocyte into bile. The protein is a P-type ATPase, characterized by cation channel and phosphorylation domains containing a highly conserved Asp-Lys-Thr-Gly-Thr (DKTGT) motif, in which the aspartate residue forms a phosphorylated intermediate during the transport cycle.

The gene is expressed mainly in liver and kidney.

Abnormal gene product. Tissue damage occurs after excessive copper accumulation resulting from lack of copper transport from the liver. Even when no transporter function is present, accumulation of copper occurs over several years.

More than 800 pathogenic variants have been identified (see Wilson Disease Mutation Database [Kenney & Cox 2007], including nonsense, missense, frameshift, and splice site variants as well as large deletions.

The most common pathogenic variant in populations of European origin is an amino acid substitution in a highly conserved motif close to the ATP-binding region (p.His1069Gln) [Tanzi et al 1993]. This pathogenic variant occurs at a frequency of 26%-70% in various populations and is associated with neurologic or hepatic disease and a mean onset age of about 20 years [Houwen et al 1995, Thomas et al 1995, Maier-Dobersberger et al 1997, Shah et al 1997].

The most common pathogenic variant in the Asian population is an amino acid substitution in exon 8, p.Arg778Leu [Thomas et al 1995], found at a high frequency in all Chinese [Gu et al 2003] and ethnically related populations studied.

Pathogenic variants in the promoter region are rare [Cullen et al 2003] except in Sardinia, where a 15-bp deletion in the 1-kb promoter region (c.-441_-427del15) predominates [Loudianos et al 1999].

"...Three Sardinian patients were found to
be heterozygous for a 15 nucleotide deletion in
the promoter of ATP7B, 441/427del, previously shown to reduce the activity of the
ATP7B promoter. We did not identify any other
mutations within the promoter and 50 UTR of
ATP7B in 164 WND chromosomes likely to be
causative of the disease. This suggests that mutations in the regulatory elements of ATP7B that
result in WND are rare in patients of white European ancestry, with the exception of Sardinia.
These observations are important for facilitating
the molecular diagnosis of WND."

"...robust genotype–phenotype correlation in the case of missense mutations has not been found so far, although complete loss of protein expression due to nonsense mutations is expected to result in a more severe phenotype

...mutations in ATP7B have various effects altering protein expression levels, catalytic and transport activity, as well as intracellular localization (Figure 6B). Mutants with a partial preserved transport function can result in later onset of disease or have variable manifestation if their stability and localization is modulated by the metabolic state of cells"

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

The product of ATP7B is copper-transporting ATPase 2, an intracellular transmembrane copper transporter that is key in incorporating copper into ceruloplasmin and in moving copper out of the hepatocyte into bile. The mechanism of disease appears to be loss of function of ATP7B resulting in **decreased/absent or altered gene product** which leads to lack of copper transport from the liver through various mechanisms inlcuding defective catalytic activity, transport and intracellular localisation. Patients can be homozygous for one disease-causing mutation or carry two different disease-causing mutations as compound heterozygotes. Mutations can affect almost all 21 exons and are frequently missense and nonsense. The missense mutation H1069Q in exon 14 is very common. About 50–80% of WD patients from Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe carry at least one allele with the H1069Q mutation. In Southern Europe, other mutations are common, such as the missense mutation M645R in mainland Spain. The R778L in exon 8 is found more frequently in South-eastern Asia where the mutation has an allele frequency of 14 to 49%2.
In Sardinia there is a 15bp deletion in the 1kb promoter region that is pathogenic. Other pathogenic variants in the promoter region are rare. Robust genotype–phenotype correlation in the case of missense mutations has not been found so far, although complete loss of protein expression due to nonsense mutations is expected to result in a more severe phenotype.
