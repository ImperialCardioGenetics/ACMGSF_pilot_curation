PMID 18774102 Barc (2011): Describes a single 2 exon deletion in a patient with long QT syndrome type 1.
PMID 18774102 Eddy (2008): Describes a single 2 exon deletion resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon in a patient with long QT syndrome type 1.
PMID 15840476 Tester (2005): Describes 88 patients with long QT syndrome and various mutations. Fourteen of these are either nonsense or frameshift mutations.

Heterozygous loss of function mutations can cause long QT syndrome type 1. Homozygous mutations result in the recessive condition Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.

**Literature review:**

"More than 500 pathogenic variants of KCNQ1 have been reported, including pathogenic missense, nonsense, splice site, and frameshift variants as well as large multiexon deletions.

**Normal gene product.** The potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily KQT member 1 is the alpha subunit forming the slowly activating potassium delayed rectifier IKs [Keating & Sanguinetti 2001].

**Abnormal gene product.** IKs channel with reduced function"

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) associated with biallelic pathogenic variants or heterozygosity for pathogenic variants in two different genes (i.e., digenic pathogenic variants) is generally associated with a more severe phenotype with longer QTc interval and a higher incidence of cardiac events [Schwartz et al 2003, Westenskow et al 2004, Tester et al 2005, Itoh et al 2010].

Compendium of Cardiac channel mutations: 29 (10% of genotype positive patients) had 2 mutations in either KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, 9 with multiple KCNQ1 variants, 7 with a KCNQ1 and a KCNH2 variant, 5 with a KCNQ1 and a SCN5A variant, 2 with two KCNH2 variants, 4 with a KCNH2 and a SCN5A variant, and 2 with two SCN5A variants.

**Missense mutations are responsible for the majority of LQT1 cases** and can cause channel loss of function through a variety of molecular mechanisms, including defects in ion permeation (altering the pathway through which ions flow through open channels), channel gating (mechanisms that regulate the opening and/or closing or channels), trafficking, KCNQ1-KCNE1 interaction, PKA-mediated signaling pathway, PIP2 binding, and calmodulin binding (Figure 4, C AND D) (Table 2). Non-missense mutations can also cause LQT1. Mutations belonging to certain groups may bear implications on patient phenotype, severity of arrhythmia, as well as response to therapy.

"Two distinct biophysical mechanisms mediate the reduced IKs current in patients with KCNQ1 mutations: (1) coassembly or trafficking defects in which mutant subunits are not transported properly to the cell membrane and fail to incorporate into the tetrameric channel, with the net effect being a â‰¤50% reduction in channel function (haploinsufficiency)5; and (2) formation of defective channels involving mutant subunits with the altered channel protein transported to the cell membrane, resulting in a dysfunctional channel having >50% reduction in channel current (dominant-negative effect)."

**Disease associated variant consequences:**

Dose Change: dose reduction: Decreased gene product level
Dose Change: dose reduction: Absent gene product
Altered gene product structure

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

Mechanism is likely loss of function of KCNQ1 due to **reduction/absence of gene product or altered gene product** due to a variety of mechanisms including defects in ion permeation, channel gating, trafficking, KCNQ1-KCNE1 interaction, PKA-mediated signaling pathway, PIP2 binding, and calmodulin binding. Missense mutations are responsible for the majority of LQT1 cases. Digenic inheritance has been described with mutations in other LQT genes.
