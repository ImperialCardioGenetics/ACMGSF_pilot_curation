To date only missense mutations have been described in the PRKAG2 gene and associated with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome, glycogen storage disease of heart and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

**Literature review:**

"PRKAG2 syndrome (PS) is a rare, early-onset autosomal dominant inherited disease, characterized by ventricular pre-excitation, supraventricular arrhythmias and cardiac hypertrophy. It is frequently accompanied by chronotropic incompetence and advanced heart blocks, leading to premature pacemaker (PM) implantation.

The syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the 5’ Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK), specifically for its γ2 regulatory subunit (PRKAG2).

AMPK is an enzyme deeply involved in cellular ATP metabolic regulation.6 PRKAG2 genetic mutations are rare and have been recognized mainly in the context of patients with non-sarcomeric familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.7

PS can show different expressivity both of ventricular hypertrophy and arrhythmic features, ranging from an asymptomatic condition to sudden cardiac death (SCD). PS can occasionally lead to heart failure (HF), or demonstrate systemic involvement.7-9

Almost all studies report missense mutations. Only
Blair et al. PMID: 11371514 documented an insertion mutation (Exon
5:InsLeu).[^8^](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4704128/#R8) The most commonly reported mutation were C.905G\>A (Arg302Gln) and c.1463A\>T (Asn488Ile), with 110 and 40 cases (respectively 57% and 21%)

*PRKAG2* mutations are suspected to modify the tridimensional structure of AMPK, altering its affinity for AMP and modifying the enzyme activity. Studies on transgenic mice have showed an enhanced enzymatic activity during the early stage of
PS and a decreased activity during the advanced
phase;  a recent study demonstrated an impaired myocardial glycogen uptake in adult patients with PS."

"Defects in *PRKAG2* are associated with a recently described cardiac syndrome triad consisting of familial ventricular preexcitation (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, WPW), conduction system disease and cardiac hypertrophy mimicking HCM. Histological studies of myocardial tissue from affected
individuals and transgenic mice expressing mutant forms of the *PRKAG2* gene confirmed glycogen storage as the
pathologic basis for this cardiac syndrome. Because of similar
echocardiographic features, *PRKAG2* disease could be misdiagnosed as HCM. Unlike HCM, however, individuals with the *PRKAG2* mutations have a higher incidence of progressive cardiac conduction disease requiring implantation of a
pacemaker. It is therefore important to distinguish hypertrophy associated with *PRKAG2* mutations from that due to sarcomere protein defects"

*Liu Y et al. 2013 (PMID:23741347)*

"Five missense mutations and one in-frame insertion have been identified in the *PRKAG2* coding sequence. The most common mutation is Arg302Gln, now identified in seven families. Variable expressivity of the clinical phenotype appears to exist and may be mutation specific. For example, in three families with the Arg302Gln mutation, symptomatic onset of disease occurs in late adolescence and cardiac hypertrophy is detected in 30% to 50% of patients. A smaller kindred with the Arg531Gly mutation has presented with severe arrhythmogenic disease as early as age 2, but exhibited no evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or LV dysfunction despite survival into their fifth decade \[[31]. However, this does not exclude the possibility of undetected myopathic disease. Interestingly, the Arg302Gln and Arg531Gly mutations occur at the identical positions within cystathionine \[beta\]-synthase domains 1 and 4, respectively. This finding may provide a basis for structure-function studies of cystathionine \[beta\]-synthase domains within *PRKAG2*.

Missense mutations in the regulatory subunit, PRKAG2, activate AMPK and cause left ventricular hypertrophy, glycogen accumulation and ventricular pre-excitation

*In vitro* studies indicate that PRKAG2 mutations decrease the
nucleotide-dependence of AMPK catalytic activity ([Scott et al.,
2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5193246/#R41)),
resulting in gain of function. Once activated, AMPK regulates multiple metabolic pathways including increased glucose uptake by GLUT4 translocation ([Kurth-Kraczek et al.,
1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5193246/#R24)) and glycolysis by phosphofructokinase-2 regulation ([Marsin et al., 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5193246/#R34))

"Since the identification of PRKAG2 as a cause of this condition, only around 200 patients have been reported in the literature. Of these cases, **22 distinct heterozygous variants have been described and all of them are located with, or in close proximity to, the adenine nucleotide binding CBS domains (Fig. 3A), which are recognized as functional regions interacting with AMP, ADP or ATP. The most frequently identified mutations are R302Q (135 cases from 14 families, ∼57%), followed by N488I (40 cases from 2 families, ∼21%) [15].** This study has added 22 more PRKAG2 cases and 4 novel mutations in the exploration journey of the disease.
All mutants here lead to disruption of the ligand-binding interfaces and/or break communication with the alpha and beta subunits which directly impacts the catalytic portion of the kinase...

**The probands bearing a PRKAG2 mutation present typically with palpitations, syncope, chest pain, or features of HF. Only 1 is identified after an abnormal ECG (Proband 7). While penetrance is 100%, as prescribed previously [14], the disease progression in our objectives for the same mutation have interfamilial variability, even heterogeneity..."**

"Clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic data from 90 subjects with PRKAG2 variants (53% men; median age 33 years; interquartile range [IQR]: 15 to 50 years) recruited from 27 centers were retrospectively studied.

Compared with previously published series (5,6,13), our cohort displayed considerable genetic heterogeneity, with a total of 26 rare unique genetic variants, most of which were missense."

There is 1 intron variant and 1 frameshift variant reported in this study. These variants are not reported on ClinVar but are predicted to be pathogenic.

"2 of the rare genetic variants (p.Arg302Gln and p.Asn488Ile) were present in 44% of the patients included in the cohort. Patients with these 2 genetic variants exhibited pre-excitation more frequently and had a lower prevalence of syncope but otherwise showed a very similar clinical profile. 

At the end of follow-up, 76% of patients (68 of 90) had signs and symptoms of PS, but penetrance of PS was only 31% at 40 years of age or less."

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

Mechanism is likely due to modified enzyme activity due to **altered gene product structure**. PRKAG2 genetic mutations are rare and have been recognized mainly in the context of patients with non-sarcomeric familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the 5’ Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK), specifically for its γ2 regulatory subunit (PRKAG2). Hu et al report that pathogenic variants are located with, or in close proximity to, the adenine nucleotide binding CBS domains. *PRKAG2* mutations are suspected to modify the tridimensional structure of AMPK, altering its affinity for AMP and modifying the enzyme activity.
Almost all studies report missense mutations. Only
Blair et al. documented an insertion mutation (Exon
5:InsLeu). There are at least 2 reports of frameshift variants being identified in PRKAG2 but the significance of these is not known. The most commonly reported mutations were C.905G\>A (Arg302Gln) and c.1463A\>T (Asn488Ile), with 110 and 40 cases (respectively 57% and 21%). There is a debate about penetrance but certainly variable expressivity of the clinical phenotype appears to exist and may be mutation specific.
