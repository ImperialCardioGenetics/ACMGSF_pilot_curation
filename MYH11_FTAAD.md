Zhu et al (2006) (PMID 16444274) described two kindreds with thoracic aortic aneurysm and/or aortic dissections (TAAD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). MYH11 was one of several candidate genes sequenced. MYH11 encodes for the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. The French kindred was found to have two heterozygous mutations in cis: the first was a substitution at the splice-donor site of intron 32 (IVS32+1G>T) and the second was a missense mutation in exon 37 (G5361A) resulting in R1758Q. The IVS32+1G>T mutation on this allele results in an in-frame deletion of 71 amino acids (L1456_N1526del) and thus a deletion of exon 32. In the American kindred in this same study, an in-frame deletion of 72-nucleotides (3810_3881del) in exon 28 leads to the loss of 24 corresponding amino acids (R1241_L1264del). In the French kindred, all individuals with the mutation were found by imaging studies to have marked aortic stiffness, even in clinically asymptomatic. None of these variants was found in 340 normal chromosomes screened. Based on functional studies, the authors postulate a dominant negative mechanism.

Familial case of non-syndromic TAAD with a MYH11 L1264P mutation, in which PDA was not observed. (Authors performed genetic analyses of mutations of the TAAD related genes including FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, TGFB2, ACTA2 and MYH11) Co-segregation was shown in a 17 member three generation pedigree. This variant was recurrent ( also observed in PMID 17666408) Absent in ExAC. Variant is in a conserved residue of a functional domain.

ClinGen Evidence for Haploinsufficiency
**All described mutations in MYH11 currently support a dominant-negative model.** In addition, MYH11 is part of a recurrent deletion mediated by segmental duplications on 16p13.11 observed in patients with intellectual disability, epilepsy and additional phenotypic features. However, patients with large deletions including this gene have not been reported to have thoracic aortic aneurysm and/or aortic dissections (TAAD) or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), providing evidence against haploinsufficiency causing this phenotype.

**Literature review:**

"We have recently described two kindreds presenting thoracic
aortic aneurysm and/or aortic dissection (TAAD) and patent
ductus arteriosus (PDA)1,2 and mapped the disease locus to
16p12.2-p13.13 (ref. 3). We now demonstrate that the disease
is caused by mutations in the MYH11 gene affecting the
C-terminal coiled-coil region of the smooth muscle myosin
heavy chain, a specific contractile protein of smooth muscle
cells (SMC). All individuals bearing the heterozygous
mutations, even if asymptomatic, showed marked aortic
stiffness. Examination of pathological aortas showed large
areas of medial degeneration with very low SMC content.
Abnormal immunological recognition of SM-MHC and the
colocalization of wild-type and mutant rod proteins in SMC,
in conjunction with differences in their coimmunoprecipitation
capacities, strongly suggest a dominant-negative effect."

*Zhu et al (2006) (PMID 16444274)*

"This study is the first to demonstrate that MYH11 mutations are a rare cause of familial TAAD. At the same time, we confirm that MYH11 are a common cause of familial TAAD associated with PDA. Two of three families with TAAD in conjunction with PDA were found to carry **novel missense point mutations in MYH11**, whereas none of the 93 families with familial TAAD alone was found to have mutations in this gene. By structural analysis, the mutations found in the TAAD/PDA families are predicted to be deleterious to protein function. Similar to two previously reported families with MYH11 mutations, **we observed variable expressivity of the mutant gene in these families**, with some family member presenting with TAAD in conjunction with PDA, some with PDA or some with TAAD alone. In addition, similar to our observations with TGFBR2 mutations (10), **decreased penetrance of the mutation was observed in some adults**, who had no known cardiovascular disease (Fig. 1A). Finally, the aneurysm in patients with MYH11 mutations involved the ascending aorta, a location where a majority of force is placed on the aortic wall with each cardiac contraction and spared the sinuses of Valsalva, which is the location of aneurysms in Marfan patients and TAAD patients with TGFBR2 mutations...

...These data suggest that MYH11 mutations are likely to be specific to the phenotype of TAAD/PDA and result in a distinct aortic and occlusive vascular pathology potentially driven by IGF-1 and Ang II."

*Pannu H et al. 2007 Oct 15 (PMID:17666408)*

"...The spectrum of MYH11 mutations identified for the familial TAAD/PDA phenotype is limited to four
mutations: a small deletion, a splice site mutation, and two missense mutations. Therefore,
MYH11 mutations can cause the disease in the
small subset of families with TAAD and PDA...

...A MYH11 missense mutation causing familial TAAD that
alters arginine 712, an invariant amino acid in
all type II myosins, is part of this α-helix. Other
MYH11 mutations are predicted to disrupt the coiled coil domain of the long C-terminal domain (66, 96). Therefore, disruption of either the motor domain or coiled-coil domain of
myosin is predicted to disrupt the structure or
function of myosin..."
*Milewicz D et al. 2008 PMID: 18544034*

"...At the molecular level, the MYH11 mutation (IVS32+1G>A) affects the canonical splice site sequence and is predicted to result in the loss of exon 32, and thus an in-frame deletion of 71 amino acids. This causes a conformational change of the α-helical coiled coil domain of the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and impairs the motor function of the protein and its assembly with a homodimeric counterpart. This mutation is similar to the IVS32+1G>T mutation previously reported and further supports a dominant negative effect for MYH11 mutations (Zhu et al 2006 PMID 16444274)."

**Disease associated variant consequences:**

Altered gene product structure

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

The majority of pathogenic variants are missense and in frame deletions. Functional evidence from Zhu et al from 2006 suggest the mechanism is likely dominant negative. An **Altered gene product structure** leads to a disruption to the structure or function of myosin. MYH11 pathogenic variants are most often associated with TAAD with patent ductus arteriosus but they are also a rare cause of FTAAD. Variable penetrance has been reported.
According to ClinGen the location of pathogenic variants is predominantly in the C-terminal coiled coil domain.
