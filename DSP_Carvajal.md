The DSP gene was the first ARVC-gene to be associated to the disease, the initial mutation description was done in Carvajal syndrome characterized by woolly hair, keratoderma and ARVC, it is transmitted in a autosomal recessive pattern, homozygous mutations in DSP were described in in the year 2000, PMID 11063735. This was followed by the description of a heterozygous mutation in DSP in an Italian family with ARVC and clear co-segregation of the variant with the disease, PMID 12373648. These findings have been replicated worldwide in several studies performed in different ethnicities, PMID 15941723, PMID 25765472, PMID 23954618, PMID 20864495, PMID 21397041, PMID 24938629.

The initial descriptions recognized also a high frequency of left
ventricular compromise in families with DSP mutations, PMID 16061754, PMID 28527814. A murine model was generated able to replicate the arrhythmia phenotype and Cx43 mislocalization, PMID 22240500. A transgenic mouse overexpressing a mutant DSP had increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, cardiac fibrosis and lipid accumulation PMID 16917092.
Abnormal DSP protein expression in DSP mutation carriers has also been reported, PMID 23137101. The role of this gene in this particular disease has been repeatedly demonstrated in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings, and has been upheld over time (in general,at least 3 years). No convincing evidence has emerged that contradicts the role of the gene in the specified disease. In summary, based on this overwhelming evidence, DSP is definitely associated with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy with woolly hair and keratoderma, maximum association score was achieved rapidly after the analysis of few main reports.

**ClinGen Haploinsufficiency phenotype comments:**

The desmosomal cardiomyopathies are often associated with a complex mode of inheritance and a highly variable pattern of protein expression. AR inheritance form mutations are often ?loss of function? mutations and AD forms are known to occur. However, there is no clear evidence that they are due to haploinsufficiency; dominant negative effect appears to be
the more likely mechanism of pathogenicity in these cases. Furthermore, whole gene deletions have not been reported in the literature. At most, haploinsuffiency may result in skin manifestations (hereditary palmoplantar keratoderma) or may contribute in a multifactorial manner to susceptibility to heart disease

**Literature review:**

"DSP is the largest among the desmosome genes and encodes the 2872 amino acid protein, desmoplakin. The N-terminus of desmoplakin is required for localization to the desmosome and interaction with plakophilin and plakoglobin. The C-terminus of desmoplakin binds to the intermediate filaments (desmin)...
A DSP mutation was first identified in a homozygous manner as the cause of Carvajal disease, which shows dilated cardiomyopathy with wooly hair and keratoedema..."

"Here, we describe the **first recessive human mutation, 7901delG,** in the desmoplakin gene which causes a generalized striate keratoderma particularly affecting the palmoplantar epidermis, woolly hair and a dilated left ventricular cardiomyopathy. A number of the patients with this syndromic disorder suffer heart failure in their teenage years, resulting in early morbidity. **All tested affected members of three families from Ecuador were homozygous for this mutation which produces a premature stop codon leading to a truncated desmoplakin protein missing the C domain of the tail region**...In contrast to null DESMOPLAKIN: mice which die in early development, the truncated protein due to the homozygous 7901delG mutation in humans is not embryonic lethal. This suggests that the tail domain of desmoplakin is not required for establishing tissue architecture during development."

Rasmussen et al. identified homozygosity for a 1-bp deletion in the DSP gene in a Turkish girl with Carvajal syndrome. Her unaffected first-cousin parents and 2 sibs were heterozygous for the mutation.

".... 4 patients with mutations in the DSP gene, 3 ARVD patients and 1 patient with Carvajal syndrome. The mutation carriers had abnormal DSP expression in both myocardial and epidermal tissue; disease mechanisms included haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative effects, or both."

*Rasmussen TB et al. 2013 Jul (PMID:23137101)*

"Desmoplakin consists of six spectrin repeats (SRs) at the
N-terminus, a central coiled-coiled rod domain, and three plakin
repeat regions at the C-terminus (Figure 3).4 The N-terminus interacts with plakophilins and plakoglobins, the rod domain forms
a dimer, and the C-terminus links desmosomes with intermediate
filaments. Alternative mRNA splicing creates two isoforms, DSP I
and DSP II, the latter of which is absent from the heart and simple epithelia.
The type and location of mutations determine the phenotype.
**Autosomal dominant Carvajal mutations occur within the SR6 region of DSP.4 Autosomal recessive Carvajal mutations occur within SR4, SR8, the variable region of the rod domain, and the C-terminal plakin repeats.4 Truncation mutations in the variable region result in loss of the C-terminus, generating an abbreviated DSP I.** Studies suggest that the resulting impaired interaction between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments manifests as the classic phenotype of Carvajal syndrome.23 DSP mutations affect cell-cell adhesion, signaling, differentiation, and morphogenesis.24 Thus, disrupting the interaction between DSP and the intermediate filament, desmin, causes failure of desmin to localize to intercalated disks and is an underlying mechanism of cardiomyopathy in Carvajal syndrome."

Cardiac involvement in Carvajal syndrome is primarily characterized by left ventricular cardiomyopathy in early childhood.20 The clinical presentation is typically heart failure rather than arrhythmia.
The major cardiac feature distinguishing Carvajal syndrome from Naxos disease is that the latter is characterized by right ventricular fibrofatty replacement of myocardial tissue with occasional left ventricular involvement. **In Carvajal syndrome, right ventricular involvement is less pronounced, and clinical presentation is typically heart failure rather than arrhythmia, which is typically seen in Naxos disease."**

"In a DNA sample from a girl who died at age 18 years with dilated cardiomyopathy, palmoplantar keratoderma, woolly hair, and tooth agenesis, Norgett et al. (2006) analyzed the candidate gene desmoplakin (DSP; 125647) and identified a heterozygous 30-bp insertion (125647.0015). The mutation was not present in her unaffected mother or 160 control chromosomes; no DNA was available from her deceased, similarly affected father. 

Chalabreysse et al. (2011) screened the DSP and plakoglobin (JUP; 173325) genes in the proband of a family with DCWHKTA and identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the DSP gene (S597L; 125647.0016); no mutations were found in the JUP gene. The proband's affected father was also heterozygous for the DSP missense mutation, but his affected older brother declined genetic testing. The mutation was not found in the unaffected mother, paternal grandparents, or 2 unaffected sibs. 

In a father and son with DCWHKTA, Boule et al. (2012) analyzed the desmosomal genes DSP, JUP, PKP2 (602861), DSG2 (125671), and DSC2 (125645), and identified heterozygosity for a missense mutation in the DSP gene (T564I; 125647.0017). No mutations were detected in the other genes, and the DSP mutation was not found in 600 control chromosomes. 

Boyden et al. (2016) analyzed exome data from a cohort of 496 kindreds with disorders of keratinization and identified 3 unrelated children with dilated cardiomyopathy, woolly hair, erythrokeratoderma, and tooth agenesis who were heterozygous for de novo tightly clustered missense mutations in the DSP gene: Q616P (125647.0021), H618P (125647.0022), and L622P (125647.0023)."

"Six AC pedigrees with 38 carriers of a dominant loss-of-function (nonsense or frameshift) mutation in DSP were evaluated by detailed clinical examination (cardiac, hair and skin) and molecular phenotyping.
All carriers with mutations affecting both major DSP isoforms (DSPI and II) were observed to have curly or wavy hair in the pedigrees examined, except for members of Family 6, where the position of the mutation only affected the cardiac-specific isoform DSPI. A mild palmoplantar keratoderma was also present
in many carriers. Sanger sequencing of cDNA from nonlesional carrier skin suggested degradation of the mutant allele. Immunohistochemistry of patient skin demonstrated mislocalization of DSP and other junctional proteins (plakoglobin, connexin 43) in the basal epidermis..."

"Our cutaneous findings are not completely unexpected. As
in Carvajal disease, the very severe, often lethal, paediatric cardiomyopathy is combined with the presence of woolly hair
and striate palmoplantar keratoderma.6 However, in those
families, the homozygous premature stop mutation is in the
third (and last) globular unit of the C-terminal tail domain of
DSP. Even though this mutation leads to a truncated protein
product and weakens the resilience of the interaction between
DSP and the keratin/desmin intermediate filaments in the
skin/heart of homozygous patients, their carrier parents
showed no sign of the cardiocutaneous disease. Interestingly,
other heterozygous cases, such as carriers of an N-terminal
in-frame duplication mutation do exhibit the Carvajal
phenotype.8 Hence, the consistent presence of this milder
cardiocutaneous phenotype in N-terminal head-domain mutations of our well-defined, relatively large, heterozygous cohort
is intriguing."

**Narrative summary of molecular mechanisms:**

Carvajal syndrome is characterized by woolly hair, keratoderma and ARVC. In 2000 three families from Ecuador were found to be homozygous for the mutation 7901delG in DSP which produces a premature stop codon leading to a truncated desmoplakin protein missing the C domain of the tail region. Since then bth AD and AR patterns of inheritance have been described. Cardiac features tend to develop in childhood and are characterised by left ventricular dilated cardiomyopathy with epicardial fibrosis, biventricular dilation. Clinical presentation is usually heart failure rather than arrhythmia. Both missense and truncating variants have been described. In a study in 2019 nearly all 38 patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy who were carriers of a dominant loss-of-function (nonsense or frameshift) mutation in DSP were found to have curly hair and palmoplantar keratoderma. The mechanism appears to be loss of function due to **reduced/absent gene product or altered gene product structure**. Sun Q et al suggested that impaired interaction between desmoplakin and intermediate filaments manifests as the classic phenotype of Carvajal syndrome.
